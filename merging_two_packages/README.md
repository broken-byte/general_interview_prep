#Merging 2 Packages
Given a package with a weight limit limit and an array arr of item weights, 
implement a function getIndicesOfItemWeights that finds two items whose sum
of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function should return a pair
[i, j] of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. If such a
pair doesn’t exist, return an empty array.

Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.
