# Flatten Nested List Iterator
You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. 
Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements 
may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator 
to flatten it.

Implement the NestedIterator class:

- NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes 
the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
  
- int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.

- boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some 
  integers in the nested list and false otherwise.
  
Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:

    initialize iterator with nestedList
    res = []
    while iterator.hasNext()
        append iterator.next() to the end of res
    return res
  
If res matches the expected flattened list, then your code 
will be judged as correct.
