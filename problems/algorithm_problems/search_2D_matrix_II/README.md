# Search a 2D Matrix II


Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a target value in an m x n integer matrix. The matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

### Example

    Input: matrix = [

        [1,4,7,11,15],
    
        [2,5,8,12,19],
    
        [3,6,9,16,22],
    
        [10,13,14,17,24],
    
        [18,21,23,26,30]

        ]

    target = 5

    Output: true
