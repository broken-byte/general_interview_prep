# Can Construct

Write a function `canConstruct(target, wordBank)` that accepts a target string, and an
array of strings

The function should return a boolean indicating whether the `target` can be 
constructed by concatenating elements of the `wordBank` array.

You may reuse elements of `wordBank` as many times as needed
